									<p><strong>Design</strong> - The durability of the product resulting in unwanted material being scattered in a home, the device not attaching properly onto surfaces causing accidents. </p>
									<p><strong>Hardware</strong> – One big risk is using an underpowered Raspberry Pi and risk the solution not working. Or purchasing a more powerful Raspberry Pi and risk overspending. Another risk with hardware is the using an under powered camera that doesn’t capture the detail required to properly identify the product. </p>
									<p><strong>Image Capture</strong> - Most of the risks that might eventuate will come from poor time management or having too many ideas and being unable to reign in on all of them in the allotted timeframe we have given ourselves. Throughout the testing phase will be the time when risks that we have not yet thought of at every stage will begin to pop up more and more. Therefore a ‘beta test’ version of the project will a what to solves this. We must be prepared to deal with specific software problems and able to either adapt them to the way we need them to work of find a better solution. We are still inexperienced in a sense we may need to have outside sources critique the idea so that we are not trapped in our own thought bubble.</p>
									<p><strong>Machine Learning and Visual Recognition</strong> – This relies on a stable internet connection, with sufficient bandwidth and data availability, which could be an issue for those in remote areas, reliant on slow and temperamental satellite links, or those using prepaid mobile data or living in a patchy coverage area. Being a cloud-based service, risks here include the provider discontinuing the service, harvesting private data or pricing the service beyond what is feasible for the device.</p>
									<p><strong>Database</strong> – Unless a periodic firmware update, and an easy method of deployment, is made available by us, the database may become unstable or open to security vulnerabilities over time. Coding bugs or an excessive number of products held in the lookup database could result in storage space filling. A third issue to be aware of is the possible need to routinely terminate unnecessary database processes as if left unchecked, these can reduce device capabilities.</p>
									<p><strong>Marketing</strong> – Like any new product, a heavy investment of time and money is required to establish need with consumers. As an underfunded start up, it is entirely realistic that the team will not be able to afford much of either resource. The risk of not finding the right investor, or finding one more interested in killing the project, is high, preventing the device from gaining traction within the marketplace. Another key risk here is that once people start to know about the device, the possibility of losing intellectual property through cloning or adapting into existing technology is high. The relative low cost and ease of entry into creating this product makes that risk even higher.</p>
