							<p>As a group we have built a strong element of communication, trust, compassion, determination and friendship in preparing this final report. We have all experienced a positive experience in this assessment, which stems from the group's ability to adapt to the members’ individual needs and fluidly shifting between lead and assisting roles at various stages of development. The group had a high degree of enthusiasm through the entire assignment, which was evident through positive and animated conversations exploring design and functionality options, sometimes at the expense of a realistic notion of timeframes and member availability. Although we communicated well through the Chat function of Microsoft Teams, in an ideal world, we would have been available more frequently for discussing and aligning on queries and working through small challenges.</p>
							<p>Compared to the first group assessment, we had more exterior commitments, which made making meetings with all members participating more difficult. The surprise easing of Melbourne COVID restrictions opened the job market, and the realism is that employment, which had not been a factor for some at the beginning of the course, took some sudden priority. For others, new pressures came from existing employment and family commitments. The enthusiasm to complete the project and support our fellow students eased the effort required to get back on top of the tasks and milestones that fell behind. The group meeting recordings will not accurately reflect the amount of communication we had outside of the meetings. We could have also definitely improved on our time management processes. We have a shared thought in saying that this report could have come together a lot easier if we had a clearer milestones that we could have better held each other to account. This would have prevented some of the productivity drift.</p>
							<p>Looking back through the assignment it is evident that this group is driven by a genuine passion, if we had a chosen a project that did not interest or challenge us that we would have struggled more. Learning this about ourselves will be a great factor moving forwards especially in the IT industry when a lot of the work being done have to be driven by that passion factor. We have also learnt that we naturally fall into roles rather than being given roles we do not enjoy. If we were to work together again this would be an important note to remember.</p>
							<p>It is of agreement that Github will definitely not show the groups participation factor in the report. Teams is where we have done most of our work as a group with other tools being used in an individual sense for editing the video presentation requirements and whatnot.</p>

									<p>The group’s enthusiasm for the project concept carried us through some difficult weeks. Significant events outside the course put sudden and additional time pressure on most within the group and this was evident through reduced communication and more sporadic work, when compared with the previous assignment. Sudden appearances of, or increases in, work was the main contributor here, as businesses started opening in Melbourne in the early stages of the assignment. For the most part, I don’t feel this had any real effect on our outputs and the quality of work produced was high.</p>
									<p>As lead developer, my communication of concept, task requirements and end state goals could have been improved, and I believe this did have some negative effect on the group’s cohesion and clarity at times, however my colleagues were comfortable stating what they were unclear about, which helped move stalled discussions forward. I continue to feel positively about this group and can genuinely state that the positive way we work together is similar to what I have seen in strong graduate groups that have spent time with my employer. Much of our work was done outside of Github, so the logs would not be an accurate reflection.</p>
									<p><strong>Patryk</strong></p>
									<p>Given that we had such a strong start with the previous assessments, I had high expectations coming into this task. Having become comfortable with communication, seeking out help from others, and a general enthusiasm to share workload, I felt we had everything under control. Time management could potentially be the only thing that could continue to be improved upon, but knowing that not just myself, but others in the group had outside responsibilities closing in on them, I felt we managed to get by in a satisfactory manner.</p>
									<p>The most surprising thing was landing myself in such an excellent group. I don’t think any of us had any expectations that this group would turn out so well for us. I learnt that through open and honest communication, and through democratic distribution of workload, group work can be enjoyable and productive. Again, as with prior assessment, most of the work was completed outside the scope of GitHub, so the log will not show the amount of work put in by most of the group.</p>
									<p><strong>Austin</strong></p>
									<p>Carrying the momentum from the first assignment, we went on a great albeit late first meeting. However, it was evident from that point on that everyone would have less time due to other commitments, and that was the case as such. I think that because of this we were communicating a bit less that Assignment 2, but not too much so that nothing was done. Everyone was still doing their part and there was still a good amount of communication in the group. Personally, I believe that I could have improved by managing my time a bit better and communicating if I had any problems a bit better with the group as well.</p>
									<p>Once again, I feel great about this group since everyone was very open-minded and a lot of great ideas were thrown around as well resulting in a much better product. I learned a lot from these guys and would carry on the ideas and thoughts they have given me. Most of the work was done on MS Teams and not on GitHub.</p>
									<p><strong>Liam</strong></p>
									<p>The group's energy from assignment two carried over into the planning and development of S.K.I.M in assignment three. I have found that my experiences working together with the other group members have been unlike any I've had in the past. I have an overwhelmingly positive impression of the team that we have built through working on the assignment tasks. The group has continued communication throughout the entirety of the assignment, and all members have carried themselves with positive intent and awareness to other's availabilities and schedules. There were segments of time where communication dropped off due to other commitments that the majority of the group members had, and this made consistent meetings become a little challenging. But we overcame this by staying vigilant and persistent on the completion of tasks and being there in support for members that had questions about the assignment.</p>
									<p>The GitHub commits have primarily been handled by the allocated team members for this assignment. I feel that we have worked on refining the processes that were used in assignment two, this has meant that for the most part, just the members responsible for the website development have made the commits to the repository.</p>
									<p><strong>Peter</strong></p>
									<p>I have once again been very privileged to work with such a supportive and enthusiastic group. This project content was significantly more difficult than the first and I had also had more time commitments come up and was unable to attribute more time than the first assessment. Time management was a huge part in which we could improve, more so for myself. If this project was to carry forward in a real sense, we would have to set a bit more of realistic deadlines on tasks for a more successful result.</p>
									<p>I was most surprised again by the group catering to my lesser understanding of the subject and taking the time to explain things to me and assisting in areas where I felt uncomfortable. I learned much about the group and how we could do things better in the future to maintain a better result. Most of the group did not do much of their work inside GitHub but I imagine more would be done in there if the project was to develop further.</p>
									<p><strong>Tom</strong></p>
									<p>Coming into Intro to IT I honestly had low expectations of group projects. I had heard numerous horror stories of dysfunctional groups and members who wouldn’t pull their weight, and honestly have experienced that through high school myself. But the team has truly shown me that group projects don’t have to be that way. Everyone knew exactly what was expected of them and then went above and beyond to make sure their jobs were done to the highest standard. There was no animosity between members, everyone was immensely helpful to one another regardless of the task at hand. There were no grumbles about what work needed to be done or how hard a task was.</p>
									<p>I feel like we all definitely improved on our communication from Assignment 2. There was always constant chatter in the Teams chat about what everyone was working on, what needed to be done and what had been done. Everyone was timely about their tasks and if someone needed help or needed a little more time on the task, they were not afraid to ask. This step up in communication I feel was appreciated by everyone. Having set out roles for every truly helped us as well. We all knew exactly what needed to be done, when it needed to be done and what would come next once we had one it.</p>
									<p>Honestly, not much if anything at all. I can honestly not flaw anyone in the team. I know personally I had issues with time management and working around work and everyone was super accommodating to that. There were other members that had commitments too and the group always stood up to help and were always accommodating to that too. So, if I were to say something could be improved upon it would be my time management, although with the times we are living in time is one of the trickier aspects to control.</p>
									<p>Overall, I am greatly appreciative to have found my way into such an amazing group. I seriously could not have asked for anything better. I have nothing but respect for everyone in this team and I hope we find each other someday whether it's in class our outside of it. Thank you, guys, for everything.</p>
