										<h2>Topic</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The aim of this project is to design and build a domestic grocery inventory tracking platform, with Raspberry Pi-based hardware, a camera and interface devices to capture images of the items being added or removed from the inventory, cloud-based machine learning software to detect items within the images, and onboard database to store the inventory, a web server to display the contents of the database to a mobile device app.</p>
									<p>The proposal is to approach a prototype of the device. We have some concerns that our current level of coding abilities and the time available may prevent us from achieving a fully functioning device, however we are confident that we will achieve: .</p>
									<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
										<li>Completion of first-generation design</li>
										<li>Achieve image capture</li>
										<li>Successfully train Tensorflow to recognise some grocery items</li>
										<li>Construct databases of common items and inventory items</li>
										<li>Design a prototype of the app</li>
									</ul>

										<h2>Motivation</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We as a group decided to pursue this project idea as we saw it as a genuine way to help the everyday consumer and put less stress on their day-to-day life. This project does have many elements and is a great passion driven idea to develop on a long-term scale. In the current climate of IT trends, it is heavily driven around making everyday life easier for businesses and consumers. From programs such as Xero have simplified bookkeeping and accounting and UberEats have simplified food delivery.  With our project we are motivated to develop a product that does exactly this, just in a different setting. The product is also attractive at a commercial level and would be adapted for this climate going forwards.</p>

										<h2>Landscape</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Within the domestic market, several refrigerator manufacturers have methods allowing owners to view the contents of their fridges from a single viewpoint. Some methods, like Samsung’s Family Hub feature an inbuilt camera and an LED panel on the front of the device allowing users a restricted view of the fridge contents on the fridge or remotely through an app (Samsung, n.d.). Others, such as LG’s “Instaview panel” offer a less technological glass pane in the fridge door (LGAustralia, 2018), allowing owners a literal, if partial, window into their fridge.</p>
									<p>Camera or panel, the current commercially available features are hampered by providing a view of a limited area of the fridge, and as the view into the fridge is from a single camera or view point, the observation of the contents is effectively two-dimensional, where objects can be hidden behind others and quantities of an item may be difficult to establish. As this project maintains and adjusts a database of the items available, it is not affected by these limitations.</p>
									<p></p>
									<p>The service being test by Woolworths, however, requires shoppers to complete an additional and manual step where the device displays a barcode that a shopper is required to scan with their app. Our project omits the need for this step, with the proposed device handling the image capture, identification of item and addition to the user’s database. A successful implementation of Tiliter’s device, called Scan&Go, would be competition for a commercial adaptation of our project, should that occur, or if Scan&Go were to evolve into a domestic device.</p>
