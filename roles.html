									<p>We chose roles for the project after defining the main work packages of the project, or streams. While we spent much of our time in our streams, there was a reasonable degree of cross-over, as those with more capacity helped those with less. From the outset, we agreed the team should be composed of:</p>
                                    <p><strong>Nathan - Head Developer, Lead Visio/AI Developer</strong><br>Nathan, who was intimate with the vision and context of the device. This person would provide cohesion in development and insights to the team, and hold the team’s scope to account against the agreed design parameters. Being the creator of the project, Nathan is perfect for this role as he knows the project inside out.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Patryk - Lead Web Developer/Assisting Hardware Developer</strong><br>Patryk, who has a passion for and skills with front-end web development. It is important to have someone working solely on the development of the website as software/web development is very nuanced and requires someone to know the process and be with the process for the duration of development.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Austin - Head of Marketing/Assisting Visio Developer</strong><br>Austin, whose language and design skills made him perfect for this role. We need a head of marketing to assist in writing promotional materials and scripting for advertisements. Having this as a discrete role provides a consistent design workflow and will help to produce the presentation as smoothly as possible.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Peter - Head of UX/Lead testing</strong><br>Peter, who is interested in user experience and shaping how tech interact with people as much as vice versa. Every product needs to have a smooth user experience. Peter will work to develop a seamless experience that works efficiently and effectively and is intuitive to the user. Being a Lead Tester will also provide up-to-date feedback on the effectiveness of the product and will keep us on track during development.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Liam - Lead Database Developer/Assisting Visio Developer</strong><br>Liam, who was looking forward to the challenge of working with something outside his comfort zone. The database is one of the key components of our product and will need to be efficient in its data storage and retrieval. Liam will work to make this process as easy on the hardware and software as possible.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Tom - Lead Hardware Developer/Assisting Web Developer</strong><br>Lead Hardware Developer/Assisting Web Developer – Tom, who, while interested in software development as a career path, appreciates the symbiotic relationship between software and hardware. Having a lead Hardware developer will introduce familiarity with the hardware in the project. Knowing the hardware inside and out and knowing how to troubleshoot and where to look for support will be crucial in making the hardware work together properly.</p>
